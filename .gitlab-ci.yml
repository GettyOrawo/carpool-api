     echo If you can see this you know that gitlab-ci is running.  You should
     uncomment the sections that enable building the docker image and running
     the acceptance tests.
     Change any file as necessary to make tests pass in your language of
     choice.  But be mindful that we will only accept challenges that are
     passing acceptance.  Good luck!

## Uncomment the following sections to enable docker, image building and
## acceptance

# build:
#   stage: build
#   image: # Add an image to build your service
#   artifacts:
#     paths:
#       - bin/
#   script:
#     - echo do something to build the binary or whatever

# build_image:
#   stage: docker
#   image: docker:latest
#   variables:
#     DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
#     DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
#     DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
#   services:
#     - docker:dind
#   script:
#     - echo As a helper here you have a sample of how to build and push a \
#     docker image to the provided gitlab registry.
#     - echo ${CI_JOB_TOKEN} | docker login --password-stdin -u ${CI_REGISTRY_USER} ${CI_REGISTRY}
#     - docker build . -t ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:latest
#     - docker push ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:latest

## Uncomment the acceptance step and do not remove or edit, this step is
## required for us to accept your submission!

# acceptance:
#   image: cabify/challenge:latest
#   stage: acceptance
#   only: 
#     - master
#   dependencies: []
#   services:
#     - name: ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:latest
